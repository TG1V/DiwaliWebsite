        <h2><br>Festival of Light</h2>
        <p>Diwali calls in the celebration of victory over evil. As legend hasit, when Maryada Purushottam Shri Rama was returning back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile from the forests, having defeated the mighty King of Lanka, Ravana, over a battle and rescueing Mother Sita from there, the paths were dark as it was a moonless night or Amavasya in the month of Kartik,
           as per Hindu calendar. Rejoicing the return of Lord Rama and Mother Sita together with Laxmana, the residents of Ayodhya knew no limits in expressing their excitement and lit up the whole city with earth lamps to illuminate
           their path.<br>Thereafter, the sublime tradition of lighting lamps on this day is still carried out with great joy and the whole world joins in to celebrate this bright festival. The Hindu Goddess of wealth and prosperity, Mahalakshmi, and Lord Ganesha,the God of intelligence,wisdom and removal of obstacles, along with Goddess of knowledge,wisdom and music, Saraswati, are also worshipped on that day. 
            What makes it even more special and Divya, is the partake of joy and sharing of sweets among nears and dears, which brings each and every one closer to one another through love and friendship. People on that day, wear new clothes and light up firecrackers to celebrate Diwali and houses are beautifully decorated with Rangoli and illuminated with lamps and lights.
        </p>

            <h2>Pooja Vidhi</h2>
            <p>In Mauritius, one week before the festival, the house and courtyard are immensely cleansed to welcome the Hindu goddess, Mahalakshmi and Lord Ganesha. 
                After that, houses are decorated with multiple LED bulbs and other decorative variants. On Diwali, people wake up early to make
                the rangoli design on the floor, enhancing the beauty of the symbolic festival. Those who celebrate this big event, leave no stone unturned to start preparing
                some mouth watering sweets in the kitchen afterwards.Once sweets are made, special evening prayers or special pooja is offered to the Hindu deities with phool(flowers), phal(fruits), diya(oil lamp), 
                dhoop(incense sticks) and Naivedya(sweet offering to God). After the special pooja is completed, houses are illuminated with oil lamps, light bulbs etc. Sweets are distributed
                among friends and family and it's a pleasure to end this beautiful festival among every one with lit firecrackers in the sky. 
            </p>
            <br><h2>Mantra and popular hymns</h2>
            <p>To help in carrying out the Devi pooja on Diwali, there is one very popular mantra which is said after the Ganesha hymn invocation:
                <br>
                <li style="text-align: center"><i>Om Asato Maa Sat Gamaya<br>
                Tamaso Maa Jyotir Gamaya<br>
                Mrityor Maa Amritam Gamaya</i></li>
            </p>
            <p>This mantra especially invoked at the end of the pooja, essentially means; Oh Mother, lead me from unreal towards real, from darkness
                towards light, from death towards the nectar of immortality. <br> The Ganesha invocation being pronounced first, goes as,
                <br>
                <li style="text-align: center"><i>Om Shri Ganeshaaya Namaha</i></li>
                <br><p>This mantra is so powerful that if invoked 108 times with full thought focus and energy assembled towards Lord Ganesha, may lead to removal of obstacles and delays and all 
                desired actions are made fruitful. </p>
